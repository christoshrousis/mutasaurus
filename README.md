# Mutasaurus

A Deno mutation testing library that helps you improve your test suite quality by introducing mutations into your code

## Features

- ü¶ï Deno-first approach
- ‚ö° High performance
- üìä Mutation coverage reporting
- üéØ Configurable mutation operators
- üîç Source map support for accurate error reporting

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Mutasaurus } from 'jsr:@mutasaurus/mutasaurus';

const mutasaurus = new Mutasaurus({
  sourceFiles: ['./src/**/*.ts'],
  testFiles: ['./tests/**/*.test.ts'],
  operators: ['arithmetic', 'logical', 'control'],
  workers: 4,
});

const results = await mutasaurus.run();
console.log(results);
```

## Configuration

#### Source files & Test Files
The suggestion at the time is to supply a list of source files to mutate, and
corresponding list of test files.

The parameters accept glob patterns.

Be mindful, that all test files in `testFiles` will run against a single mutation,
so performance is not linear.

Let `m` be the number of possible mutations
Let `t` be the number of test files
Let `s` be the number of source files

For each mutation that's created `m`, we need to run every test file `t` against it. This creates a multiplicative relationship:
`O(m √ó t)`

However,  the number of possible mutations `m` is also dependent on the number of source files `s` and the number of possible mutation points within each source file. 
If we consider `p` as the average number of possible mutation points per source file, then:
`m = s √ó p`

Therefore, the total complexity relationship could be defined as:
`O(s √ó p √ó t)`

All this is to say, if you define the relationships between the source files and the test files, you can improve the speed of
the mutation test harness.

So this:

```typescript
const featureAMutations = new Mutasaurus({
  sourceFiles: ['./src/a/1.ts', './src/a/2.ts', './src/a/3.ts'],
  testFiles: ['./tests/a/1.test.ts', './tests/a/2.test.ts'],
});
const featureBMutations = new Mutasaurus({
  sourceFiles: ['./src/b/1.ts', './src/b/2.ts', './src/b/3.ts'],
  testFiles: ['./tests/b/1.test.ts', './tests/b/2.test.ts'],
});
const resultsA = await featureAMutations.run();
const resultsB = await featureBMutations.run();

```

will perform better than this:

```typescript
const mutasaurus = new Mutasaurus({
  sourceFiles: ['./src/**/*.ts'],
  testFiles: ['./tests/**/*.test.ts'],
});
const results = await mutasaurus.run();
```

#### Exhaustive Mode
The test suite will only run a subset of cherry picked mutations that attempt to balance speed & accuracy.
If you suspect you want to run all possible permutations, you can pass a `exhaustiveMode: true` to 
Mutasaurus constructor to increase the number of mutants.

```typescript
const mutasaurus = new Mutasaurus({
  exhaustiveMode: true
});
```

This will increase the `p` in `O(s √ó p √ó t)`

## Examples

TODO [Real-world examples]

## Development

This project assumes Deno 2.x or later.

### Formatting Code

```bash
deno task fmt
```

### Linting

```bash
deno task lint
```

### Testing

```bash
deno task ok
```

Note: Currently there is only a single E2E test

## Road to V1

- Parity mutation support with StrykerJS.
- Use coverage reporting to run test suite subset to increase performance.
- Implement cache system to avoid re-running whats not required.

## Contributing

To contribute to this project:
- Read the project goals.
- Write some code.
- Make sure `deno task ok` passes.
- Open a PR.

## Project Goals

This project started as an academic endeavor to explore mutation testing in Deno's ecosystem. The core question was "Can I create a mutation testing library written in Deno?"

Moving Forward, the guiding principles are:

- **Deno-First**
  - Built exclusively for Deno projects.
  - Should take cues from Deno's overall mission, and align where possible.
- **Performance-Focused**
  - Leverages V8 isolate and Web Workers for parallel execution
  - Smart defaults that balance coverage with execution time
  - Configurable mutation patterns for advanced use cases such as exhaustive coverage
  - Potential for Rust-based core components if performance demands it
- **Developer Experience**
  - Single-command setup and execution out of the box
  - Clear, actionable error messages with Deno-style hints
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples
  - Integration with Deno's testing ecosystem
